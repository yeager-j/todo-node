# Node Todo
A full stack todo app written in Node. 

## About
About a month ago, I wrote a boilerplate MEAN project so I wouldn't have to waste time with the basics. Why re-invent the wheel, right? Because of this, the project has authentication and a nice front-end using Material Design. 

You can find my boilerplate here: https://github.com/yeager-j/mean-starter
